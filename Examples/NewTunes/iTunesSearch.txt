	- Small artist images on the left with Artist name on the right, last album release date.
	- Line devider, then display of the next artist
- Change the application name.
- Add a detail page
	- When the artist from the main page is clicked, it takes the user to the detail page.
	- The detail page includes all items for that artist.
- Add ability to add new artists to the list
	- New page that allows a search term to be entered
	- Results of artists are shown in a list view with their most recent album image
	- Artist IDs are stored on the device. 
- Service Layer
	- Add username and password
	- Add service layer that will save the users selected artists, check for updates for any artists they 	are watching, send push notifications.
	- Do caching here
- Add an options page (switch from push notifications to pull or turn off (use manual update))
- Add a nice tile icon that displays the push notification count and maybe small images of the latest album images.
